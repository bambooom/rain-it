# WIP: Take a break ☕️ Rain It ☔️

- inspired by [emoji-rain](https://github.com/notwaldorf/emoji-rain), created by @notwaldorf, very cute
- try to learn canvas and maybe Vue by doing a simple demo
- why? just for fun~ ✨
- [demo page](https://bambooom.github.io/rain-it/)

## download
-> [release](https://github.com/bambooom/rain-it/releases)

- download `rain-it.crx`
- open `chrome://extensions/` in chrome
- check `developer mode` on the upper right corner (important)
- drag downloaded `rain-it.crx` in to install

## use it
- when you get tired
- click the extension button 
- aha~ it rains....with a random emoji, maybe 😂
- now, you cannot click on the web page, since the rain lives on a canvas which cover the page. 
- you can only scroll the page 😉
- -> click the extension button again when it's enough  😎
